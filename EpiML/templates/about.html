                    of mutations. If all mutations are additive, fitness will fall proportionally to mutation number
                    (black line). When deleterious mutations display negative (synergistic) epistasis, they are more
                    deleterious in combination than individually and so fitness falls with the number of mutations at an
                    increasing rate (upper, red line). When mutations display positive (antagonistic) epistasis, effects
                    of mutations are less severe in combination than individually and so fitness falls at a decreasing
                    rate (lower, blue line). </p>
